Idea
====

A simple job que system that enables repetitive cron job like tasks to happen in the browser persistently as a user browses from page to page on your website. 

Why and when would this be useful? Imagine as the Federated Social Web or Indie Web grows- and some peoples self hosted websites start having subscribers in the 10,000 - 100,000+ range and since messages will need to be federated to different nodes this could become a heavy task, especially also if some syndications never complete (due to load and such).

Examples
========

* Syndication of status updates, messages, and content to social networks
* Downloading of content from other nodes
* 


Thoughts? 
=========

I am not the JS guru nor a sys admin well versed in scaling apps to the 100,000 user range. I wish I was, but I know many others out there are- maybe something like this already exists, maybe the idea is half baked. 

Please give me feedback, tear me a new one, etc... :)
